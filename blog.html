            <h2>What is difference between local storage and session storage?</h2>
            <p>Ans:
                Their main difference is that local storage data does not expire, whereas session storage data gets
                cleared when the user closes its browser window.<br>
                Page sessions are valid for only one tab at a time. So, if a user has three tabs open, each one will
                have its own page session.<br>
                Since local storage is not session-based, all the data must be deleted via javascript or manually.

            <h2>What is difference between global scope and block scope?</h2>
            <p>
                A variable exists inside or outside a block. If a variable is declared outside all functions or curly
                braces ({}), it exists in the global scope. The global variables can be accessed by any line of code in
                the program, including inside blocks.<br>
                The variables that are declared within the block scope are comparable to local ones. They are available
                within the block that they are defined. The block statements (e.g. if conditions or for loops), don't
                create a new scope. So the var keyword will not have an effect, because the variables are still in the
                same scope.

            <h2>How does the event loop works in javascript?</h2>
            <p>The event loop is a process that waits for the Call Stack to be clear before pushing callbacks from the
                Task Queue to the Call Stack. Once the Stack is clear, the event loop triggers and checks the Task Queue
                for available callbacks. If there are any, it pushes it to the Call Stack, waits for the Call Stack to
                be clear again, and repeats the same process.
